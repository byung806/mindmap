Generate a structured learning graph for [INSERT TOPIC] that enables efficient, in-depth learning.

### Schema
class Node:
 - link: str                # Direct URL to a high-quality resource (article, video, paper, or documentation)
 - title: str               # Descriptive title of the resource
 - overview: str            # One-sentence summary of what the learner gains from this resource
 - topic: str               # Category or subfield grouping related nodes (e.g., "Fundamentals", "Mechanics", "Competitive")

class Edge:
 - source: Node             # Prerequisite or foundational concept
 - target: Node             # Dependent or advanced concept

### Output Format
Graph {
  nodes: [ ... ],
  edges: [ ... ]
}

### Generation Guidelines
1. Include **exactly 25 nodes** that together form an efficient, comprehensive learning path.
2. **Prioritize learning efficiency** — order concepts so foundational topics appear before advanced ones.
3. **Favor authoritative sources** (official websites, seminal papers, or well-regarded tutorials).
4. Organize nodes **hierarchically** from fundamentals → intermediate → advanced → applied topics.
5. Each edge must represent a **meaningful conceptual or practical dependency**.
6. **Allow cross-topic and bidirectional edges** to reflect real-world relationships (not just a strict tree).
7. Group nodes into clear topical clusters (e.g., “Fundamentals”, “Mechanics”, “Competitive”, “Generations”, “Alternate Formats”, “Lore”).
8. Keep the graph **clean and minimal** — no redundant or overly narrow nodes.
9. After generating the graph, return a **summary** that includes:
   - total nodes
   - total edges
   - max depth of the graph (longest dependency chain)
   - brief description of the overall structure (e.g., how clusters interact)

### Output Rules
- Return only the JSON-like graph structure and the final summary.
- Do not include extra commentary or markdown formatting.
